    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <article>
      <p>
        I’m Abdullah Muhammad Khalid — a Python and Django developer with a strong foundation in backend engineering, data processing, and automation workflows. Based in Karachi, Pakistan, I bring hands-on experience in developing scalable applications that align with both technical and business requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        My expertise lies in building high-performance web solutions using Django and RESTful APIs, automating manual processes through custom Python scripts, and implementing data pipelines for insight generation. I work extensively with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Matplotlib, while adhering to clean code practices and modular architecture.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve successfully developed and deployed real-world projects, including:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Job Trend Analyzer:</strong> A real-time job market tool scraping and analyzing demand across roles, cities, and required skills.</li>
          <li><strong>Disease Checker:</strong> A frontend-backend integrated medical support tool leveraging condition-based data analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Inventory Fraud Management System:</strong> Anomaly detection for stock transactions and misuse in small business environments.</li>
          <li><strong>Resume Optimization App:</strong> AI-assisted matching tool for resume scoring and job description alignment.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m currently enrolled in a specialized program in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at SMIT. My learning path is focused on expanding into Machine Learning, Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch), NLP, and Computer Vision, along with large language model (LLM) integration and deployment using tools like Streamlit, FastAPI, and Hugging Face.
      </p>

      <p>
        My approach combines technical proficiency with a product mindset — building solutions that are not only technically sound but also user-centric, maintainable, and performance-driven.
